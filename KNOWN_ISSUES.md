# Known Issues

## input-color

The component InputColor is a wrapper for the native HTML element `<input type="color">` which has accessibility problems:

- With NVDA, the element is announced as "clickable" and not as an input element.
- It's not possible to select a color using a screen reader.

For full accessibility, consider using predefined colors lists, e.g. using KolSelect or KolCheckbox.

## `aria-sort` changes sometimes not announced in NVDA

When a table column changes its sort order (i.e. when its `aria-sort` attribut changes), screen readers announce this change automatically.  
For unknown reasons, this sometime does not happen in NVDA.

[🐞 NVDA issue #8132](https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/8132)

## input-number and input-date 'readonly' not announced in NVDA

The components InputNumber and InputDate render their respective native HTML elements `<input type="number">` and `<input type="date">` which both support the
attribute `readonly`.  
When focusing the element, it's expected that the `readonly` attribute is announced as part of the element description. This isn't the case for NVDA.

## Deactivated buttons appear through the `dialog` -tag

If  the HTML dialog tag is used instead of the modal component, it can happen that deactivated elements are visible in the background through the dialog.
If possible use the dialog in the DOM at the end. This way, the deactivated elements no longer appear through the dialog.
