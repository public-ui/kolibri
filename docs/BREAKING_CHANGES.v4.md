# Breaking Changes for version 4

## Introduction

New major versions of KoliBri are developed with the goal of simplifying maintenance and support and promoting further development.

For more information, see the [KoliBri Maintenance and Support Strategy](https://github.com/public-ui/kolibri/blob/develop/MIGRATION.md).

## Changed Components

### All components

- The `_id` prop has been removed from components that use Shadow DOM. IDs within a shadow tree are not visible outside, so each component now generates its own stable ID internally and manages all references. For tests or external lookups, set an `id` on the host element instead.
